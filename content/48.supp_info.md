### Supplementary Material

![Number of nonzero coefficients (model sparsity) across varying regularization parameters, for 71 genes (TCGA to CCLE prediction, top) and 70 genes (CCLE to TCGA prediction, bottom) in the Vogelstein et al. dataset.](images/generalization/supp_figure_1.png){#fig:average_sparsity width="100%"}

![Value of norm of coefficient vector vs. performance, for EGFR mutation status prediction from TCGA to CCLE. The _x_-axis shows the value of each norm for each model, binned into quantiles in order to plot results on the same axis since each norm has a different scale.](images/generalization/supp_figure_2.png){#fig:norms_vs_perf width="100%"}

![Distributions of performance difference between cross-validation data (same cancer types as training data) and holdout data (cancer types not represented in data), grouped by held-out gene. Each point shows performance for a single train/validation split for one cancer type that was held out, using a classifier trained to predict mutations in the given gene.](images/generalization/supp_figure_3.png){#fig:average_perf_by_gene width="100%"}

![Top row: Distribution of performance differences when thyroid cancer (THCA) data is held out from training set across seeds/folds, grouped by gene. Bottom row: Distributions of performance differences for genes where THCA is included in training/holdout sets, relative to other cancer types that are included.](images/generalization/supp_figure_4.png){#fig:thca_by_gene width="100%"}

![Performance vs. dropout parameter (first column) and weight decay strength (second column), for EGFR mutation prediction (first row) and KRAS mutation prediction (second row) using a 3-layer fully connected neural network trained on TCGA (blue/orange) and evaluated on CCLE (green).](images/generalization/supp_figure_5.png){#fig:nn_dropout_wd width="100%"}
