![Number of nonzero coefficients (model sparsity) across varying regularization parameter settings for KRAS mutation prediction using SGD and `liblinear` optimizers, and averaged across all genes for both optimizers. In the "all genes" plot, the black dotted line shows the median parameter selected for `liblinear`, and the grey dotted line shows the median parameter selected for SGD.](images/optimizers/supp_figure_1.png){#fig:compare_sparsity tag="S1" width="100%"}

![Distribution of performance difference between best-performing model for `liblinear` and SGD optimizers, across all 84 genes in Vogelstein driver gene set, for varying SGD learning rate schedulers. Positive numbers on the x-axis indicate better performance using `liblinear`, and negative numbers indicate better performance using SGD.](images/optimizers/supp_figure_2.png){#fig:compare_all_lr tag="S2" width="100%"}

![Sum of absolute value of coefficients + 1 for KRAS mutation prediction using SGD and `liblinear` optimizers, with varying learning rate schedules for SGD. Similar to the figures in the main paper, the `liblinear` x-axis represents the inverse of the $C$ regularization parameter; SGD x-axes represent the untransformed $\alpha$ parameter.](images/optimizers/supp_figure_3.png){#fig:coef_weights_lr tag="S3" width="100%"}

![Decomposition of loss function into data loss and L1 penalty components for KRAS mutation prediction using SGD optimizer, across regularization levels, using varying learning rate schedulers. 0 values on the y-axis are rounded up to machine epsilon, i.e. 2.22 x 10^-16^.](images/optimizers/supp_figure_4.png){#fig:loss_lr tag="S4" width="100%"}

![Performance on held-out data for DepMap gene essentiality prediction from cell line gene expression for 13 different genes, across cross-validation splits.](images/optimizers/supp_figure_5.png){#fig:essential_boxes tag="S5" width="100%"}

![Performance vs. regularization parameter for DepMap gene essentiality prediction, for `liblinear` coordinate descent and SGD using a search over constant learning rates. "Holdout" dataset is used for SGD learning rate selection, "test" data is completely held out from model selection and used only for evaluation.](images/optimizers/supp_figure_6.png){#fig:essential_curves tag="S6" width="100%"}
